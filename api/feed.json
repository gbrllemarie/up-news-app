Concepcion and DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña opened the event with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. “<em>Sa UP hindi lang tayo nagsasaliksik upang tumuklas lamang ng bagong kaalaman. Lahat ng nais nating gawin sa UP ay inilalaan natin ang ating panahon, yaman at kakayahang taglay sa mga saliksik na magdudulot ng pakinabang sa buong sambayanan. . . . Ang agham po sa UP ay para sa bayan. Ang UP ay agham bayan… </em>[In UP, we are doing research not just for the sake of discovering new knowledge. Everything that we do in the University is dedicated through our efforts, resources and expertise to researches that benefit the Filipinos and the nation. Science for UP is for the nation. UP is <em>agham bayan</em>],” Pres. Concepcion said during his welcome remarks.</p>\n<p>On exhibit was a display of scientific works divided into four themes: health and well-being, environment, food, and human resource development-job creation. Along with the research exhibits, there were interactive technology demonstration corners as well as actual discussions with project leaders and scientists present at the event.</p>\n<p>The panel discussions brought together: primary stakeholders of science, technology, and innovation, government and industry leaders, including faculty members and researchers from UP and other state universities and colleges; policy makers; and, investors discussing policy implications and utilization of scientific research and innovation benefiting the public.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-7105 size-full\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan2.jpg\" alt=\"Featuring researches on health and well-being as one of themes of this year's Aghambayan festival (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)\" width=\"1184\" height=\"787\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan2.jpg 1184w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan2-1024x681.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1184px) 100vw, 1184px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Featuring researches on health and well-being as one of the themes of this year’s Aghambayan festival (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p>The industry panel discussion was moderated by UP alumna and ABS-CBN’s ANC anchor Michelle Ong. It was attended by some industry leaders: Roberto Amores of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), and Dan Lachica of Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines (SEIPI). Discussions were on the importance of research and development (R&amp;D) especially to major industry investors. These emphasized the need to review existing policies pertaining to R&amp;D as well as to patent and intellectual property issues.</p>\n<p>With Aghambayan showcasing UP’s science innovations which are in collaboration with DOST providing practical value to Filipino’s everyday lives, DOST Secretary Dela Peña stressed that “this endeavor has gone far in achieving its goal, take for example, in uplifting the lives of agricultural farmers and its sector.” He continued, “This is a gift to the whole country. And the DOST does not work with UP alone; in fact, we have launched the ‘Science for Change’ program to accelerate science and technology innovation through a massive investment in science and technology, human resource development and R&amp;D. We are working aggressively to establish lead-centers for R&amp;D in the regions through the R&amp;D leadership program, and efforts to connect R&amp;D institutions with industry. So, with this kind of program, we hope to have more activities like Aghambayan to manifest DOST’s strategy: science for the people.”</p>\n<p>For the government panel discussion, UP alumna and GMA documentarist and journalist Kara David was the moderator, of with DOST Sec. Dela Peña and NEDA Usec. Adoracion Navarro among the key panel discussants. They raised issues on: funding support, strengthening commercialization, knowledge transfer and patent, the government’s trust in the research products of scientists and academe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7106\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aghambayan3.jpg\" alt='Top officials from the government and industry sectors also receives from UP President Danilo Concepcion and DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña the \"Better Living Through Science and Technology\" handbook.

Or there are those who study late into the night only to realize it’s far too late to go out and buy a proper meal,” says UPLB Housing Office (UHO) Director Zoilo Belano Jr. on how the idea of edible gardening in dorms came about.

This was to take better care of food sources that have naturally grown around the dorms, such as papaya and banana, as well as new ones they intend to plant.</p>\n<p>The edible gardens at dorms are at different stages of development, with some having more variety of produce than others. Belano explains that this is due to varying terrain and manpower availability, although the UHO will continue to work on improving the productivity of the gardens with less produce.</p>\n<p>At present, the most developed is the International House Residence Hall garden, where they’ve planted tomato, okra, cucumber, habanero pepper, strawberry, and blueberry, among many others. The other dorms have string beans, mustard greens, eggplant, chili pepper, sweet potato, ginger, squash, etc. Those that need more work are the gardens at the Women’s Residence Hall and the Veterinary Medicine Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>Belano says that the gardens will continue to be developed and maintained through organic farming methods.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7085\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Edible-gardening_body-03.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right, International House residents Joeseph Quisado and Vanessa Jane Acabal with Dorm Manager Honey Faith Roa-Evangelista and UPLB Housing Office Director Zoilo Belano Jr. (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)\" width=\"1333\" height=\"1013\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Edible-gardening_body-03.jpg 1333w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Edible-gardening_body-03-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Edible-gardening_body-03-768x584.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Edible-gardening_body-03-1024x778.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>From left to right, International House residents Joeseph Quisado and Vanessa Jane Acabal with Dorm Manager Honey Faith Roa-Evangelista and UPLB Housing Office Director Zoilo Belano Jr. (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p><strong>Not just for students</strong></p>\n<p>The UHO is thinking big and it plans to expand its edible gardening initiative to the faculty and staff housing sector. “We have five residential zones for faculty and staff, and what we want is to have at least one common garden for each zone,” reveals Belano.</p>\n<p>Apart from promoting a healthier lifestyle through nutrient-rich foods, gardening is known to be beneficial to physical, mental, and emotional health for all ages.

He gave the example of distinguished Filipinos throughout history, such as Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, as well as the Kalinga hero of the Martial Law period, Macli-ing Dulag, as individuals who, when they were young, managed to view their individual lives from within the context of broader societal struggles despite peril to themselves and to their loved ones.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7066\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5184\" height=\"2912\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio3.jpg 5184w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio3-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio3-1024x575.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Members of the UP Baguio Class of 2018 pose for a photograph.

In this effort, they would be aided by their UP education, which had shaped their minds to be inquisitive and critical (<em>mapagtanong at mapanuri</em>), both inside and outside the classroom.</p>\n<p>Taking full advantage of this gift, however, required a deep and penetrating understanding of history. “<em>Ang pagiging mulat sa kasaysayan at kaganapang panlipunan ang magtitiyak sa malalim na pagsusuri sa alinmang </em>trending <em>na kaisipan</em> at mga usaping umiiral sa ating panahon<em>.” </em>(An understanding of history and society ensures a deeper analysis of any ‘trending’ idea or conversation in our times.) This understanding, he said, served as a foundation for our convictions, as well as a tool to remedy society’s ills.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7067\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio4.jpg 5184w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baguio4-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>UP President Danilo Concepcion (3rd from left) joins Chancellor Raymundo Rovillos and officials from UP Baguio in singing UP Naming Mahal.

Mama, when she was alive, sold food at the school.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6876\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/entry-for-JOYA.jpg\" alt=\"Entry for the Joya Art Awards (Posted on March 17, 2014 wyndelle.wordpress.com)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"849\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/entry-for-JOYA.jpg 1200w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/entry-for-JOYA-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/entry-for-JOYA-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/entry-for-JOYA-1024x724.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Entry for the Joya Art Awards</em><br><em>(Posted on March 17, 2014</em><br><em>wyndelle.wordpress.com)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p>Remonde earned money designing and selling shirts, doing commissioned work, joining art and design contests, penetrating Cebu’s pop-underground scene where his bizarre comic style found an audience.</p>\n<p>All the while, he struggled to develop his works to become truly an art form and to be appreciated as such. “My style is a product of blood and tears. I came up with it after several years of working it out. That is why now, I do not compromise my style.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Precocious years</strong></p>\n<p>The years began with a child in Argao town, Cebu, finding escape from life’s difficulties in cartoons, which he would himself draw with skills he derived from a self-taught father.

It must have been a proud moment for him to be recognized in high school for his talent for cartooning, which found an outlet in the editorial page of the school paper.</p>\n<p>Yet, while still in UP Cebu for a certificate course in Fine Arts Major in Painting, cartooning took a back seat, as UP gave him the opportunity to explore mediums and other styles. And of course, nobody in Painting school did cartoons, and he did not do cartoons in UP until he earned his certificate. But when he set out for the outside world, the opportunities offered by companies—graphic, animation, book illustration, and design—called for comics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6877\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nag-aalab-na-Puso.jpg\" alt=\"Nag Aalab na Puso Acrylic and Textile Paint on Paper 2.25 ft x 2 .32 ft 2017 (Photo from wyndelle.wordpress.com)\" width=\"450\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nag-aalab-na-Puso.jpg 450w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nag-aalab-na-Puso-236x300.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nag Aalab na Puso</em><br><em>Acrylic and Textile Paint on Paper</em><br><em>2.25 ft x 2 .32 ft</em><br><em>2017</em><br><em>(Photo from wyndelle.wordpress.com)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p>Five years of this in Cebu City finally enabled him to support a bachelor’s degree education, and he went back to UP all set on comics as the way to go. True to its character, UP gave him the freedom to pursue this style in his Fine Arts course Major in Studio Arts. And thus, Remonde’s art, new to the art world but one he always had from the beginning, was enriched, distinguished at the onset by a sense of social awareness typical of a life of struggle.</p>\n<p>With UP’s academic freedom and a deeper knowledge of the world, he found the courage to stand by the interest he had had since childhood.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The cradle of his art</strong></p>\n<p>“In UP, I was free and encouraged to express what we felt and had in mind, in art or otherwise; and that freedom I still carry to this day,” Remonde says. Until now, he is free to regard issues with the humor and irony of a satirist, rendering many of his works counter-cultural. The works are rife with similarly bizarre, surreal, cartoonish imagery of the contemporary as viewed from his strange inner world, which does not necessarily alienate the masses, with whom he has identified with through the years.</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, Cebu is really on my mind when making art. Since I am from Cebu province, I want to take off from here and I want to contribute in developing the local art scene, which is smaller compared to Manila,” Remonde, who has also been exhibited in Manila galleries, says.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6878\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0281.jpg\" alt=\"Remonde with his work at UP Cebu's Sentenaryo exhibit.

We need to break out of these limitations so that we would not feel our art has nowhere else to go. Many have already succumbed to the limitations and stopped,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Thus another struggle of the artist, located far from the center, has been to break into the center.</p>\n<p>“I am lucky to be stubborn, and because I haven’t stopped, I have been noticed by Manila art circles and other galleries.”</p>\n<p>And so, the journey continues. The carabao plods and the heart beats—for his family, his fellow Cebu youth artists, and his art.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["PROFILES","comic","contemporary","UP Cebu Fine Arts"]},{"title":"Meet the giant clam fam","pubDate":"2018-06-22 04:41:59","link":"https://www.up.edu.ph/index.php/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/","guid":"https://www.up.edu.ph/?p=6852","author":"Stephanie Cabigao","thumbnail":"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/giant-clams-thumbnail-150x150.jpg","description":"\n<img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/giant-clams-thumbnail-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/giant-clams-thumbnail-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/giant-clams-thumbnail.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\">It is impossible to miss those electric colors—shifting from olive green to brown or dark green to violet; those shining in brilliant shades of blue and green; or the ones freckling in mixed colors of yellow, green, and brown; and especially those looking regal in mottled patterns of yellow-brown, green or gray—when passing through the waters of Silaqui Island in Bolinao, Pangasinan.

Seven of these are found in the Philippines, four of which are home to University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute-Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML). These giant clams are being cultured both at its onshore hatchery and ocean nursery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>A peek through UP Marine Science Institute-Bolinao Marine Laboratory’s ocean nursery at Silaqui Island in Bolinao, Pangasinan </em></p>\n<p><em>(Video by Rubie Esmolo, UP MSI-BML and Stephanie Cabigao, UP MPRO)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Giant clam fam</strong></p>\n<p>The bands of olive green to brown or dark-green to violet clams are the <em>Tridacna gigas</em>, more commonly known as the true giant clams, because adults have such immense shells. In the Philippines, they’re called <em>taklobo</em>, a term which applies to most giant clam species, according to administrative aide Julio Curiano Jr. Particularly, these species of <em>T. gigas</em> are locally called <em>buk</em><em>à</em>, with reference to the clam’s gaping habit, Curiano adds.</p>\n<p><em>Hagdan-hagdan</em>, the Filipino name for <em>Tridacna squamosa</em>, is the type of giant clam in mottled patterns of mixed yellow, green, and brown. Those in brilliant shades of blue and green in linear patterns are called <em>Tridacna derasas</em>. Another member of the BML’s clam fam is the <em>Hippopus</em><em> hippopus</em>, locally called <em>kukong-kabayo,</em> in mottled patterns of yellow-brown, green, or gray.</p>\n<p>The magnificent colors that these species produce are part of a process of symbiosis. Curiano explains that giant clams are symbiotic with zooxanthellae, particularly <em>Symbiodinium microadriaticum.</em> “Zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates that live within the clam’s mantle, where they are able to photosynthesize, reproduce, and grow in large numbers,” Curiano says. He adds that the presence of giant clams makes the ocean conducive for various fish species to reproduce, making it rich and abundant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-6855 size-full\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Curiano_giantclams.jpg\" alt=\"UP MSI-BML giant clams research assistant Julio Curiano Jr. holds a Tridacna derasa straight out of the ocean nursery.

Curiano describes how these species are male from zero to seven years old. Thereafter, they are able to release both sperm and egg. He theorizes that since giant clams are sessile creatures—or fixed in one place—they have adapted to become hermaphrodites for their survival. The highest egg production recorded by the Marine Science Institute was 105 million eggs from a 61-cm clam.</p>\n<p>However, giant clams are cultured at the BML in a different way from their natural spawning. Curiano says that his team takes 20 giant clams from various cohorts during the spawning phase. “We do away with inbreeding because it has a lesser chance of survival,” he adds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The oldest and the largest </strong></p>\n<p>Curiano is a fisheries graduate from Samar. It was only through a job advertisement in a daily newspaper that he learned about giant clams when the BML opened its research aide post. He immediately applied for the post, and soon after, he was seeing these huge clams for the first time in 2006.</p>\n<p>He recalls that it was in 1983 when Dr. Edgardo Gomez, in collaboration with Dr. Angel Alcala, surveyed the waters off Bolinao, and eventually discovered the depletion of the giant clams there. That same year, they acquired three juvenile giant clams all the way from the Solomon Islands. Since 1985, the BML has been able to increase the number of giant clams, as well as to distribute them to as far as the United Kingdom and Germany.</p>\n<p>Two of the three giant clam pioneers from the Solomon Islands are still alive today, with a massive size of 98.3 centimeters, the largest giant clams recorded in the country. BML also holds the biggest <em>kukong-kabayo </em>(<em>Hippopus hippopus</em>) at 90.3 centimeters, with <em>T. derasa</em> growing as large as 93.6 centimeters; and <em>hagdan-hagdan </em>at 87.6 centimeters. These gentle giants have a lifespan of 50 to 60 years, according to Curiano.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Passing through Site 3 of UP MSI-BML ocean nursery where adult and juvenile giant clams are cultured. </em></p>\n<p><em>(Video by Rubie Esmolo, UP MSI-BML and Stephanie Cabigao, UP MPRO)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The parent giant clams are 35 years old today. Currently, the BML watches over a total of 35,687 adult giant clams at its ocean nursery, and about 62,000 juveniles at the hatchery. Curiano explains that they grow these juveniles to about 3 centimeters at the onshore hatchery before they are released into the wild.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A giant clam marine reserve</strong></p>\n<p>On board the giant clam program are Rubie Esmolo and Vanessa Joy Diamante. Both are research assistants like Julio Curiano. They are also in charge of the BML’s research and extension programs.</p>\n<p>“A marine reserve is set to be established soon in collaboration with BML and the local government unit of Bolinao,” Diamante says excitedly. “What the BML and the LGU of Bolinao want is to make this part of Bolinao a protected and ecotourism area. We got word from the LGU that the bill has already been passed calling Bolinao the giant clam capital of the Philippines. So, we are moving forward to our next goal, making the marine reserve happen.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6857\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VanDiamante_giantclams.jpg\" alt=\"UP MSI-BML giant clams research assistant and extension programs coordinator Vanessa Joy Diamante (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"798\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VanDiamante_giantclams.jpg 1200w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VanDiamante_giantclams-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VanDiamante_giantclams-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VanDiamante_giantclams-1024x681.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>UP MSI-BML giant clams research assistant and extension programs coordinator Vanessa Joy Diamante (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p>She adds, “The ordinance for establishing the marine reserve is on its way. As we await its public hearing, we are now working with the residents of Silaqui Island on forming a people’s organization that will prepare them as primary point persons of the marine reserve. This will be significant to the lives of the residents of the island as well as to BML, because it will provide us with the financial resources to sustain the training and maintenance of the giant clam nursery.”</p>\n<p>Aside from maintaining the giant clam facility, Rubie Esmolo is focused on the upcoming extension activities of the BML. She points out the success of its public information seminar in March with law Prof. Jay Batongbacal on the protection and conservation of Philippine marine biodiversity, particularly at Benham Rise and the West Philippine Sea. Another activity was an open-house exhibit and the launch of the Adopt-a-Clam project in April.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-6856 size-full\" src=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RubyEsmolo_giantclams.jpg\" alt=\"UP MSI-BML giant clams research assistant and extension programs coordinator Rubie Esmolo (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"798\" srcset=\"https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RubyEsmolo_giantclams.jpg 1200w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RubyEsmolo_giantclams-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RubyEsmolo_giantclams-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RubyEsmolo_giantclams-1024x681.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>UP MSI-BML giant clams research assistant and extension programs coordinator Rubie Esmolo (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>\n<p>The team takes pride with its successful participation in the 4<sup>th</sup> Asia Pacific Coral Reef Symposium in June, as well as with its several trainings, outreach and environmental programs showcasing the BML’s research initiatives.
